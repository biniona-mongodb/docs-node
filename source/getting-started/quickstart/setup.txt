       Ensure your system has Node >= 8 and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed. You
       can verify whether you have Node and NPM installed by executing the following in
       your terminal.

       .. code-block:: sh

          node -v
          npm -v

       You should see output similar to the following:

       .. code-block:: sh

          v12.14.1
          6.13.4

       If you need to install Node and NPM, refer to `nodejs.org <https://nodejs.org>`_
       for installation instructions.
