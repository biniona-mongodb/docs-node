    ----------------------

    Ensure your system has Node >= 8 and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed. You
    can verify whether you have Node and NPM installed by executing the following in
    your terminal.

    .. code-block:: sh

       node -v
       npm -v

    You should see output similar to the following:

    .. code-block:: sh

       v12.14.1
       6.13.4

    If you need to install Node and NPM, refer to `nodejs.org <https://nodejs.org>`_
