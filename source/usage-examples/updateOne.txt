Update a Document
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can update a single document using the `updateOne() <https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.3/api/Collection.html#updateOne>`_ method. 
``updateOne()`` takes a filter for a document, and updates the first document
that matches the filter.

Create an Options object to specify additional options. Specify the
``upsert`` option to create a new document if no documents match the
filter.  To receive acknowledgment in the response from MongoDB that the
write operation was performed on the specified number of :manual:`mongod
</reference/program/mongod>` servers, set the ``w`` option. 

The ``updateOne()`` method returns a document containing information such
as the number of documents that match the filter, and the number of
documents that were modified.
