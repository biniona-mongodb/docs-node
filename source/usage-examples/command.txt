Run A Command
=============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can run all :manual:`non CRUD </crud/>` database operations using the
:node-api:`command </Admin.html#~command>` method. Typically ``the command interface`` is used
for diagnostic and administrative tasks, such as fetching server stats
or initializing a replica set. 

.. note::
    Using ``collection methods`` instead of raw database commands
    through the ``command()`` is recommended for beginner users, since
    ``collection methods`` are wrappers that abstract some configuration.
