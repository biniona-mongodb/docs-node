=============
Run a Command
=============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can run all raw database operations, not including
:manual:`CRUD </crud/>` operations, using the :node-api:`command()
<Admin.html#~command>` method. Call the ``command()`` method with
your command object on an instance of ``Admin`` for diagnostic and
administrative tasks such as fetching server stats or initializing a replica
set.

.. note::
    Use :manual:`collection methods </reference/method/js-collection>`
    instead of raw database commands whenever possible.

Create an object to specify options. Set the ``maxTimeMS`` field of this
object to state the number of milliseconds to wait before terminating the
query.

The ``command()`` method returns a :mdn:`Promise
<Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>`. The Promise returns
the results of the command operation when it completes.


.. note::
    This example connects to an instance of MongoDB using a :manual:`connection-string </reference/connection-string/>`. To learn more about connecting to your instance of MongoDB, see the `connection guide </fundamentals/connection>`_
