Run A Command
=============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can run all :manual:`non CRUD </crud/>` database operations using the 
:node-api:`command() </Admin.html#~command>` method. Typically ``command()`` is used for diagnostic and administrative tasks, such as fetching server stats or initializing a replica set. 

.. note::
    Using :manual:`collection methods </reference/method/js-collection>`
    instead of raw database commands through the ``command()`` is
    recommended for beginner users, since ``collection methods`` are
    wrappers that abstract some configuration. 

Create an `Object
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object>`_
to specify additional options. Set the ``maxTimeMS`` field of this object to state 
the number of milliseconds to wait before aborting the query.

The ``command()`` method returns a `Promise
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>`_
that resolves to an object containing the return object of the operation that was run.
