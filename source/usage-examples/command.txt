Run A Command

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can run all ``non-CRUD`` database operations using the
``db.commands()`` method. Typically ``the command interface`` is used
for diagnostic and administrative tasks, such as fetching server stats
or initializing a replica set. 

.. note::
    Using ``collection methods`` instead of raw database commands
    through the ``command()`` is recommended for beginner users, since
    ``collection methods`` are wrappers that abstract some configuration.
