Create a Document
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can create a single document using the `insertOne()
<https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.3/api/Collection.html#insertOne>`_
method. The ``insertOne()`` method inserts a document into the specified collection
using a document object. If the specified collection does not exist, the ``insertOne()``
method creates the collection. 

Create an `Object
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object>`_
to specify additional options. Set the ``bypassDocumentValidation`` option to bypass
:manual:`schema validation <core/schema-validation/>` rules in MongoDB 3.2 or higher.

The ``insertOne()`` method returns a `Promise
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>`_
that resolves to an object. The ``insertedId`` field of this object is
the ``_id`` of the inserted document. The ``insertedCount`` field of
this object has a value of 0 if a document was not created, and a value
of 1 if a document was created.
