Watch for Changes
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can watch for changes in MongoDB by using the `watch()
<https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.5/api/Collection.html#watch>`_ method. ``watch()`` opens a :manual:`Change Stream</changeStreams/>`, that allows applications to watch for changes to data and react to those changes. After opening a ``Change Stream`` you can process the change events using the `changeStream.next()
<http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.4/api/ChangeStream.html#next>`_ method.
