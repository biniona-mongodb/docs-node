Watch for Changes
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can watch for changes in MongoDB, such as changes to a collection,
database, or deployment, by using the :node-api:`watch()
</Collection.html#watch>` method. ``watch()`` opens a :manual:`Change
Stream</changeStreams/>`, that allows applications to watch for changes
to data and react to those changes. After opening a ``Change Stream``,
you can process the change events using the
:node-api:`changeStream.next() </ChangeStream.html#next>` method.
``watch()`` takes an optional ``pipeline`` parameter that is an array of
:manual:`stages </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/#stages>` to
filter the change events output. You can close a change stream using the
:node-api:`changeStream.close() </ChangeStream.html#close>` method.

Create an `Object
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object>`_
to specify additional options. Set the ``fullDocument`` option to the
string ``updateLookup`` to include the changes to the document as well as
the entire altered document.

The ``watch()`` command returns a ``Change Stream`` instance. The
``changeStream.next()`` method returns a promise that resolves to an
object with the change events. The ``documentKey`` field of this object
is an object that contains the _id of the changed document.
