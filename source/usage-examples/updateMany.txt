Update Multiple Documents
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can update multiple documents using the ``updateMany()`` method. 
``updateMany()`` accepts a filter object, and updates the documents
that match the filter using a provided update document. The update
document requires an :manual:`Update Operator
</reference/operator/update>` to modify a field in a document.

Create an `Object
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object>`_
to specify additional options. 

The ``updateMany()`` method returns a `Promise
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>`_
that resolves to an object. The ``modifiedCount`` field of this object
shows how many documents were modified. The ``upsertedId`` field contains the ``_id``
of the new document if a document was upserted.
