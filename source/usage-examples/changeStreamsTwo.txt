=====================
Watch for Changes Two
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb


You can keep track of changes in MongoDB, such as changes to a
collection, database, or deployment by opening a Change Stream. A Change
Stream allows applications to watch for changes to data and react to
those changes. You can open a change stream by calling the watch()
method on a collection, database, or deployment. The watch() method
takes an optional pipeline parameter that is an array of stages to
filter the change events output. 

The watch() method can take in additional options. Set fullDocument to
'updateLookup' to receive an event that contains the changes to the
document as well as the entire altered document.

The watch() command returns a Change Stream instance. You can use a
stream to process the change events by calling
``changeStream.on('change', callback)``. To free up resources after
processing the change events, you can call the close() method to stop
watching for changes.
